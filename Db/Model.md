# Model

Common logical data models :

- Hierarchical model : Organized data in tree structure. It's a tree consisting of many segments. It uses one to many relationships. The data access is  also predictable. (XML)
- Network model : Conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. It's iewed as a graph in which object are nodes and relationship are arcs
    + Graph_database : is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data (Neo4j)
- Relational model : Structure and language consistent with first-order predicate logic, where all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations
- Entity–relationship model : Composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships between entities (instances of those entity types).
- Object model : A database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming
- Document model : Is a computer program designed for storing, retrieving and managing document-oriented information. (MongoDB)
- Entity–attribute–value : Encode, in a space-efficient manner, entities where the number of attributes that can be used to describe them is potentially vast.
- Star schema : the star schema is the simplest style of data marts chema and is the approach most widely used to develop data warehouses and dimensional data marts
