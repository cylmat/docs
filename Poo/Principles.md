# Programming principles

1) Composition over Inheritance
 + classes should achieve polymorphic behavior by their composition rather than inheritance from a parent class.
3) Programming to Interface

Composition vs aggregation
- Composition: include inside  (delete composition => delete elements)
- Aggregation: include virtual (delete only aggregation, not elements)
